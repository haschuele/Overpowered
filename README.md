# Overpowered

The power grid is big and complicated, so it’s no surprise that the process of adding new power generators to the grid is too. In order to connect a generator to the grid, developers have to submit an application to the grid operator’s Interconnection Queue. The Queue is notoriously slow and often ends with developers dropping out.

As we move towards a better, greener grid, we need an improved application process. That’s where Overpowered’s interactive tool comes in. By recommending groups of applicants to be studied together and providing visibility into the results, we can speed up processing, encourage sharing infrastructure costs, and reduce failed applications.

Let’s get to a greener grid, faster.

This group project was conducted in the UC Berkeley MIDS' "Capstone" course. Code snippets for this project can be found [here](). You can access the tool [here](https://overpowered-dm3diygcbm7tjtbibxwnfu.streamlit.app/). Please note, the application has not been maintained since the end of the course in April 2024.
